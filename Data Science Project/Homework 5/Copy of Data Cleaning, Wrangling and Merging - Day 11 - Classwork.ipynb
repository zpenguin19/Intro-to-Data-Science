Replacing values in a column\n","\n","We can replace values in a column by first accessing that column and using the Series method `replace()` (*remember accessing one column from a DataFrame returns a pandas Series*). The `replace()` method can accept a dictionary of items in which the dictionary keys are the values to be replaced and the dictionary values are the new values to be inserted.\n","\n","We will demonstrate this method by replacing the values `Y` and `N` in the `Cataloged` column to the more explicit values `Yes` and `No`, respectively. Also, we will edit the DataFrame directly by including the keyword argument `inplace=True`."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# print the columns and the number of values and datatypes for reference\n","paintings.info()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"7nwJT1cqPEV_","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739451476176,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":43,"user":{"displayName":"Aditi Mallavarapu","userId":"10841255308974642251"}},"outputId":"b1c49f3b-058f-4932-d40a-5a63db6e9174"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 2350 entries, 0 to 2349\n","Data columns (total 21 columns):\n"," #   Column           Non-Null Count  Dtype         \n","---  ------           --------------  -----         \n"," 0   Index            2350 non-null   int64         \n"," 1   Title            2350 non-null   object        \n"," 2   Artist           2349 non-null   object        \n"," 3   ConstituentID    2349 non-null   Int64         \n"," 4   Date             2339 non-null   object        \n"," 5   Medium           2349 non-null   object        \n"," 6   Dimensions       2345 non-null   object        \n"," 7   CreditLine       2343 non-null   object        \n"," 8   AccessionNumber  2350 non-null   object        \n"," 9   Classification   2350 non-null   category      \n"," 10  Department       2350 non-null   category      \n"," 11  DateAcquired     2340 non-null   datetime64[ns]\n"," 12  Cataloged        2350 non-null   category      \n"," 13  ObjectID         2350 non-null   int64         \n"," 14  Depth (cm)       403 non-null    float64       \n"," 15  Diameter (cm)    12 non-null     float64       \n"," 16  Height (cm)      2350 non-null   float64       \n"," 17  Weight (kg)      3 non-null      category      \n"," 18  Width (cm)       2350 non-null   float64       \n"," 19  DateYear         2339 non-null   Int64         \n"," 20  OilPainting      2349 non-null   category      \n","dtypes: Int64(2), category(5), datetime64[ns](1), float64(4), int64(2), object(7)\n","memory usage: 310.6+ KB\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"-kHP3TvINEga","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739451476176,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Aditi Mallavarapu","userId":"10841255308974642251"}},"outputId":"d4229ea9-86b4-43ba-ecc9-7c8a1a6c4da4"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["['Y', 'N']\n","Categories (2, object): ['N', 'Y']"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":39}],"source":["# Print the unique values contained in the \"Cataloged\" column using the\n","# DataFrame method unique()\n","paintings[\"Cataloged\"].unique()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"9ju5LX_gNEga","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739451476188,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":14,"user":{"displayName":"Aditi Mallavarapu","userId":"10841255308974642251"}},"outputId":"beadde3a-8c5e-4671-c865-94ad4e33a700"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["<ipython-input-40-848903d94ec0>:2: FutureWarning: The behavior of Series.replace (and DataFrame.replace) with CategoricalDtype is deprecated.
